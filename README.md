### About the Project

The project is an analysis of the Ballona Freshwater Marsh's long-term filtration capacity.

The code is run in Jupyter Notebook using Python Pandas tools

- Most of the analysis reported in the paper is done in Ballona_data.ipynb that analyzed 20 years of bacteria levels in the Ballona Freshwater Marsh.

- Additional analysis was conducted in County_data.ipynb, which examines six years of water-quality data from waterways surrounding the marsh, including heavy metals and pesticide concentrations in addition to bacterial indicators. Much of this analysis is not reported in the paper.
